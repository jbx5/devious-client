	 * special attacks, so the difference can be taken between the cycle a player's special attack drains and the end
	 * cycle of the created projectile.
	 * <p>
	 * For example, a dorgeshuun crossbow will have its projectile end 63 cycles after a spec at distance 1, 66 at
	 * distance 2, etc. Hence, we can extrapolate its formula to be {@code int cycles = 60 + distance * 3}.
